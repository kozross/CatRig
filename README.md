# CatRig

## What is this?

My build documentation for a [RatRig V-Core 3.1][ratrig].

## Part lists

Prices are in NZD, and assume no sale is currently on. All costs are per-part:
thus, the cost is multiplied by the number required. If something comes in
larger volumes than listed, the cost is per-part: for example, for screws that
come in packs of 10, the listed price will be one-tenth of the pack price.

Printed part costs assume use of [Prusament ASA][prusament-asa] with the RatRig
[recommended settings][ratrig-settings]. We will use two colours: a primary
colour (in my case, [Sapphire Blue][prusament-asa-sapphire-blue]) and an accent
colour (in my case, [Galaxy Black][prusament-asa-galaxy-black]). Printed part
listings will indicate which colour you need for it.

## Sources

Everything here assumes someone building in New Zealand: in other areas, you
might have better options. Thus, Aliexpress sellers make a frequent appearance.
Some of these sellers are due to a good reputation in the community or good
personal experiences; we also use recommended suppliers for components if
they're on Aliexpress.

### Extruder

CatRig uses a [Sherpa Micro][sherpa-micro].
