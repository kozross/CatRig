# CatRig

## What is this?

My build documentation for a [RatRig V-Core 3.1][ratrig].

## Part lists

Printed part costs assume use of  [Prusament ASA][prusament-asa] on the RatRig
[recommended settings][ratrig-settings]. Costs are per part (thus, not taking
required number into account); if a linked part is bulk, that quantity is
assumed (so a 50-screw link will divide the cost by 50).

## Sources

Priority is given to Aliexpress, as sourcing anything from basically anywhere
else in New Zealand is a lost cause due to shipping. Some suppliers are given
preference, due to both personal and community experience. However, for any
community designs, preference is given to their suppliers if Aliexpress.

### Extruder

CatRig uses a [Sherpa Micro][sherpa-micro].
