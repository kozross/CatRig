# CatRig

## What is this?

My build documentation for a [RatRig V-Core 3.1][ratrig], with 300 x 300 build
volume. I'm also noting down things I've learned, and just useful information
for builders of such printers in New Zealand.

## Where's all the useful information?

You probably want the [wiki](https://github.com/kozross/CatRig/wiki).
