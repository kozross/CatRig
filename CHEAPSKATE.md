# Money-saving tips

The CatRig build is designed to be reasonably budget-friendly. However, some
corners simply should not be cut, and some choices made could be done cheaper,
but weren't for personal reasons. In the interests of the budget-conscious, here
are a few corners that you can cut if you prefer, with some suggestions of how.

## Filament

The choice of Prusament ASA is somewhat higher-end, both because ASA is a more
expensive material and because Prusament is a more expensive filament brand. It
is completely possible to replace ASA with ABS, and Prusament with some other
brand. However, before you do this, it's worth bearing in mind:

* ABS smells more and warps more than ASA, which potentially might make your
  life more difficult.
* Cheap filament will likely cause worse parts, more printing issues, and thus,
  in the long run, probably costs more.
* Filament is by far not the biggest cost in the build.

Bearing all this in mind, here are some (somewhat New Zealand-oriented)
suggestions:

* Do not buy from a reseller you don't personally know. Their primary business
  model is 'best margins', which means you're either paying more for
  manufacturer-brand filament, or being sold the lowest-tier garbage they can
  get away with relabelling. This is especially true of New Zealand resellers -
  beware!
* Ensure that whoever you're buying from either has a TDS on their website, or
  at least can provide one on demand. If they can't (or won't) this is a _huge_
  red flag, as it either suggests negligence or outright fraud.
* ASA will generally not come cheaper than NZD40 per kilo and still be ASA. ABS
  can be had cheaper, but you definitely get what you pay for.
* Don't buy in volumes less than 1kg. You end up paying more per length, and
  this stuff lasts practically forever. Even if you don't think you'll need it,
  you probably will.
* Prefer smaller manufacturers, even if they cost more. Big players dominate the
  filament industry (like most others), and usually win on vertical integration
  and cost-competitiveness, rather than quality. Furthermore, smaller
  manufacturers contribute more to local economies, pay more taxes, and
  generally act as less of a burden on society, especially if they're local to
  you.

Following all the advice above, Prusa turn out (paradoxically) to be the best
source of ASA in New Zealand, mostly due to shipping charges. Many other
manufacturers either straight up don't ship here (Paramount3D, looking at you)
or charge absolutely _extortionate_ amounts for shipping (Aurarum, for shame). I
can't give ABS advice, as I don't use it.

## Extruder

For reasons of coolness, the reverse Bowden tube uses coloured PTFE. You can
save some money getting clear PTFE instead.

## Hotend

While West3D's Undertaker is a fantastic nozzle, it's also fantastically
expensive, especially when shipping is factored in. The TD6S kit from
Trianglelab used in the build comes with a brass nozzle, which is perfectly
serviceable if you don't plan on printing anything fancy. Additionally, the
build fits V6-style nozzles, which can be had for various kinds of cheap.

Some advice regarding nozzles:

* Avoid nozzles with inserts. These have a habit of falling out, rendering your
  nozzle useless in the process.
* Don't bother with hardened steel nozzles. Even with the ceramic heater core
  used by the TD6S, these have bad thermal performance, and thus require pushing
  much higher temperatures to get the same effect.
